[[CONF_FOLDER]]
By default, {program} will look for its configuration files in the ~/.deb-publish-simple folder. You can override this with the {b}CONF_FOLDER{/b} environment variable. Example:{br}
CONF_FOLDER=/home/john/deb-conf-alternative {program} ...{br}
Setting the variable just before invoking {program} will point the CONF_FOLDER elsewhere.
